# ðŸ§ª **Lab**

Welcome to the **Lab** â€” the playground of Codelogium.

This is the space where theory meets practice.<br> 
Here, youâ€™ll find quick guides, cheatsheets, and hands-on examples designed to help you tackle real-world challenges. 

This is where I test, break, and rebuild. Expect practical deep dives, hands-on experiments, side projects, and explorations of tools like Git, Docker, CI/CD, and more.

Whether you're looking for a fast reference or experimenting with new tools, the Lab is your go-to spot for practical knowledge. <br> 
Dive in, and start building!

- [Simple Crypto Portfolio Project](../lab/post/crypto-portfolio.md)  
  _A small project to track and display crypto holdings â€” mostly for fun, learning, and a bit of frontend/backend experimentation._

- [Intro to Docker](../lab/post/docker-intro.md)  
  _A crash course on containers, images, and why I finally stopped avoiding Docker._

*(More experiments coming soon...)*
