## Project Overview

This space is my digital notepad, my logium, my messy mind organized — or at least *trying to be*.

I often dive deep into tech topics, sometimes bounce around — discovering new passions or revisiting old ones. Despite all the tools out there, I still love good old paper, notebooks, pens, and pencils.

But hey, why not digitize it?

Thus, **Codelogium** was born:  
A simple space for my notes, thoughts, ideas, and learnings in the world of code.

## What's Inside?

Well… probably nothing revolutionary.

But here’s what you *might* stumble upon:

- 🚀 Java & Spring (Boot, Security, REST...)
- 🐍 Python & FastAPI
- 🧠 Databases (SQL, ORM, H2, Postgres...)
- 🌐 Networking basics & useful concepts
- 📚 Books, ideas, random sparks of inspiration
- 🧪 Experiments, drafts, projects-in-progress

And maybe more... or less. Depends on the day 😄

## Just One Promise

No boring stuff (hopefully).  
This is more of a log than a guide — raw, honest, sometimes chaotic.
